It featured a design that balanced sportiness with practicality, offering more cargo space than its competitors while maintaining Audi's distinctive styling. Engine options included four and six-cylinder TFSI petrol and TDI diesel units, with the high-performance SQ5 initially offered as a diesel in Europe (making it Audi's first diesel S model) and later as a petrol model in North America. A facelift in 2012 updated the styling and added new technologies. The first-generation Q5 quickly became one of Audi's best-selling models globally."
